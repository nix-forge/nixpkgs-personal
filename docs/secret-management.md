# Secret management policy

This policy covers repository administration, GitHub Actions, local package
development, NUR metadata, and future release automation in nixpkgs-personal.
The package collection is public and must be safe to fork and inspect.

## Storage and handling

Credentials, private identities, provider keys, and private source archives
belong in the operator's secret backend or in GitHub's protected repository or
environment secret stores when automation genuinely requires them. They must
never be committed, placed in the Nix store, embedded in package expressions
or tests, passed as command-line arguments, or printed in logs, artifacts,
issues, or pull requests.

Pull-request workflows, including workflows for forks, receive no repository
secrets. The current package and compatibility checks are designed to run
without them. If release automation later needs cloud access, it will use
short-lived GitHub OIDC credentials and an explicitly protected environment
rather than a long-lived key.

## Access and review

Repository administrators review Actions secrets, environments, Pages, and
future release access before granting it. Access begins at the narrowest role
needed, is individual rather than shared, and is removed when responsibility
ends. New secret use requires a pull request documenting its purpose, scope,
workflow, and failure behavior without exposing its value.

## Rotation and incident response

Secrets are rotated at least annually and immediately when a maintainer,
provider, workflow trust boundary, or authorization scope changes. Suspected
exposure triggers revocation, replacement, log and artifact review, and a
private vulnerability report or incident record. Rotation must not publish an
old or replacement value in repository history.

`security/vex.json` contains only reviewed non-affectability statements. It
must never contain secret values or private deployment details.
