# SLSA build scope

This repository is a public Nix package collection and NUR-style submission.
It does not currently publish compiled GitHub release assets. Consumers build
package outputs from reviewed expressions and fixed source hashes.

Because there is no distributed release subject, this repository makes no SLSA
Build Level 3 claim for routine CI outputs, NUR evaluation, documentation, or
the flake itself. Artifact attestations belong on software or archives that
consumers download, not on transient test results.

If a package or source archive becomes a supported release artifact, its
release workflow must call the pinned
`nix-forge/ci/.github/workflows/slsa-source-release.yml` reusable builder. The
builder must create the exact bytes and provenance, while a protected publisher
verifies the signer workflow before release. The builder commit and consumer
verification command must be recorded in the release documentation.

See the [SLSA Build specification](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/) and
[GitHub's artifact-attestation guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/artifact-attestations)
for the distinction between source inputs and distributed build artifacts.
