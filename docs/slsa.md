# SLSA build scope

This repository is a public Nix package collection and NUR-style submission.
It does not currently publish compiled GitHub release assets. Consumers build
package outputs from reviewed expressions and fixed source hashes.

Because there is no distributed release subject, this repository makes no SLSA
Build Level 3 claim for routine CI outputs, NUR evaluation, documentation, or
the flake itself. Artifact attestations belong on software or archives that
consumers download, not on transient test results.

If a package or source archive becomes a supported release artifact, its
release workflow must call the pinned
`nix-forge/ci/.github/workflows/slsa-source-release.yml` reusable builder. The
builder must create the exact bytes and provenance, while a protected publisher
verifies the signer workflow before release. The publisher must attach the
portable `*.intoto.jsonl` SLSA provenance bundle beside every release
archive and verify it against the exact release bytes, source tag, and
pinned builder before publishing the immutable release. The builder
commit and consumer verification command must be recorded in the release
documentation.

See the [SLSA Build specification](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/) and
[GitHub's artifact-attestation guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/artifact-attestations)
for the distinction between source inputs and distributed build artifacts.
